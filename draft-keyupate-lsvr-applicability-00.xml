      <t>
	Within a Data Center, a common network design to interconnect servers is done using the CLOS
	topology <xref target="CLOS"/>. The CLOS topology is fully non blocking and the topology is
	utilized using Equal Cost Multipaths (ECMPs). In a CLOS topology, the minimum number
        of parallel paths between two servers is determined by the width of a tier-1 stage as shown in
        the figure 1.

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Justification for BGP modifications">
      <t>
	Many data centers
        use BGP as a routing protocol to create an overlay as well as an underlay network for their CLOS
        Topologies to simplify layer 3 routing <xref target="RFC7938"/>.
        However, BGP is a path vector routing protocol Since it
        does not have a way for creating a topology, it uses hop-by-hop EBGP peering to
        facilitate hop-by-hop routing for the creating underlay network and for resolving any
        overlay nexthops.
        The hop-by-hop BGP peering imposes several
        restrictions within a CLOS. It severly prohibits a deployment of Route Reflectors/Route
        Controllers as the EBGP peerings are inline with the data path. The BGP best path algorithm is
	prefix based and it prevents announcements of prefixes to other BGP speakers unless the best
        path is executed for the prefix.
        These restrictions significantly delay the overall convergence of the underlay
        network within a CLOS.
      </t>

      <t>
        The LSVR SPF modifications allow BGP to overcome these limitations. Furthermore, using the NLRI format
        of <xref target="RFC7752"/> allows SPF to be computed on BGP LSVR data easily as <xref target="RFC7752"/>
        facilicates announcement of node, link, and prefix information.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="bgpspf" title="LSVR Applicabity to CLOS Networks">
      <t>
        With the BGP SPF extensions <xref target="I-D.keyupate-lsvr-bgp-spf"/>, the BGP
        best path computation and route computation are replaced with OSPF-like
        algorithms <xref target="RFC2328"/> both to determine whether an BGP-LS NLRI
        has changed and needs to be readvertised and to compute the routing domain.
        These modifications will significantly improve convergence of the underlay
        while affording the operational benefits of a single routing protocol
        <xref target="RFC7938"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since every router in the BGP SPF domain will have a complete
        view of the topology, BGP sessions are not required on every link in the data center
        fabric as with the hop-by-hop peering model described in <xref target="RFC7938"/>.
        Rather, protocols such as BFD <xref target="RFC5580"/> can be used
        to determine the availability links and switches in the data center fabric. Consequently,
        the BGP session topology can be much more sparse than the data center fabric topology and
        can utilize a BGP route reflector hierarchy with the desired level of redundancy.
      </t>
      <t>
        Data center controllers typically require visibility to the BGP topology to compute
        traffic-engineered paths. These controllers learn the topology and other relevant
        information via a BGP-LS address family <xref target="RFC7752"/> which is totally
        independent of the underlay address families (usually IPv4/IPv6 unicast). Furthermnore,
        in traditional BGP underlays, all BGP routers will need to advertise their BGP-LS
        information independently. With the BGP
        SPF extensions, controllers can learn the topology using the same BGP advertisements
        used to compute the underlay routes. Furthermore, these data center controllers can
        avail the convergence advantages of the BGP SPF extensions. The placement of controllers
	could be outside of the forwarding path or within the forwarding path.
      </t>
       <t>
	Alternatively, as each and every router in the BGP SPF domain will have a complete view
	view of the topology, the operator can also choose to configure BGP sessions in hop-by-hop
	peering model described in <xref target="RFC7938"/> along with BFD <xref target="RFC5580"/>.
	In doing so, while the hop-by-hop peering model lacks inherent benifits of the controller based model, 
	BGP updates need not be serialized by BGP bestpath algorithm in either of these models. This
	helps overall network convergence.
      </t>
	    
      <section anchor="lsvrsafi" title="Usage of LSVR SAFI">
      <t>
        BGP SPF extensions <xref target="I-D.keyupate-lsvr-bgp-spf"/> defines a new BGP SAFI for
	for announcement of BGP SPF routes. The NLRI format and its associated attributes follows
	the format of BGP-LS for facilitate node, link and prefix annoucements. Whether the peering
	model within a CLOS follows hop-by-hop peering described in <xref target="RFC7938"/> or any
	controller based peering, an operator can exchange BGP SPF SAFI routes over the BGP peering
	by simply configuring BGP SPF SAFI between the necessary BGP speakers.
      </t>
       <t>
	BGP SPF SAFI can also co-exist with BGP IP Unicast SAFI which could exchange overlapping IP routes. 
        The routes received by these SAFIs
	are evaluated, stored and announced seperately according to the rules of <xref target="RFC4760"/>. The tie-breaking
	of route installation is a matter of local policies and preference to the operator and their network.
       </t>
	      
       <t>
	Finally as the BGP SPF peering is done following the procedures described in <xref target="RFC4271"/>, all the
	existing tranport security mechanisms including <xref target="RFC5925"/> are made available for BGP SPF SAFI.
