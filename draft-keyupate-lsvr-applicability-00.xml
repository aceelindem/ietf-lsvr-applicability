      <t>
	This document discusses the usage and applicability of Link State Vector Routing
	(LSVR) extensions in the CLOS architecture of Data Center Networks. The document is
	intended to provide a simplified guide for the deployment of LSVR extensions.

      <t>
	This document complements <xref target="I-D.keyupate-lsvr-bgp-spf"/> by
	discussing the applicability of the technology in a simple and fairly common
	deployment scenario, which is described in <xref target="usecases"/>.

      <t>
	After describing the deployment scenario, <xref target="motivation"/>
	will describe the reasons for BGP modifications for such deployments.

      <t>
	Once the control plane routing protocol requirements are described,
	<xref target="bgpspf"/> will cover the LSVR protocol enhancements
	to BGP to meet these requirements and their applicability to Data Center

	BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>, BGP-SPF <xref target="I-D.keyupate-lsvr-bgp-spf"/>.

    <section anchor="usecases" title="Common Deployment Scenario">
      <t>
	Within a Data Center, a common network design to interconnect servers is done using the CLOS
	topology <xref target="CLOS"/>. The CLOS topology is fully non blocking and the topology is
	utilized using Equal Cost Multipaths (ECMPs). In a CLOS topology, the minimum number
        of parallel paths between two servers is determined by the width of a tier-1 stage as shown in
        the figure 1.
      </t>

      <t>
	The following example illustrates multistage CLOS topology.

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Justification for BGP modifications">
      <t>
	Many data centers
        use BGP as a routing protocol to create an overlay as well as an underlay network for their CLOS
        Topologies to simplify layer 3 routing <xref target="RFC7938"/>.
        However, BGP is a path vector routing protocol Since it
        does not have a way for creating a topology, it uses hop-by-hop EBGP peering to
        facilitate hop-by-hop routing for the creating underlay network and for resolving any
        overlay nexthops.
        The hop-by-hop BGP peering imposes several
        restrictions within a CLOS. It severly prohibits a deployment of Route Reflectors/Route
        Controllers as the EBGP peerings are inline with the data path. The BGP best path algorithm is
	prefix based and it prevents announcements of prefixes to other BGP speakers unless the best
        path is executed for the prefix.
        These restrictions significantly delay the overall convergence of the underlay
        network within a CLOS.
      </t>

      <t>
        The LSVR SPF modifications allow BGP to overcome these limitations. Furthermore, using the NLRI format
        of <xref target="RFC7752"/> allows SPF to be computed on BGP LSVR data easily as <xref target="RFC7752"/>
        facilicates announcement of node, link, and prefix information.
